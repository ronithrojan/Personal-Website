<h3>A little bit about me...</h3>
<p>
  Welcome to my very own portfolio! I am a 2019 Public Health graduate from
  Wayne State University turned Software Developer! I am specifically skilled in
  Front-End Development, but I want to learn back-end development as well! My
  hopes and dreams is to become a full-stack developer :)
