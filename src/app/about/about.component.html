        Hello! My name is Roniya Rojan, and I am a recent graduate from
        Grand-Circus Coding Bootcamp (front-end focused)! Before bootcamp even
        started, I was a pre-medical student at Wayne State University. During
        my time in college, I was interested in coding! I would sit in with
        peers and observe the personal projects they have developed. Through
        their guidance, I was able to learn the fundamentals of HTML5/CSS.
        <br />
        <br />
        Graduating last year with a Bachelor in Science in Public Health, I
        realized my passion lies in software development. When I heard about
        Grand-Circus, I knew I had to take a workshop class to see if I can do
        this! In that one hour session, I have learned a lot of skills, and I
        was determined to finish this program in three months. Over the months,
        I learned a lot of skills, and I was challenged everyday. I aspire to
        become a full-stack developer in the near future, and I am ready to take
        on my next adventure!!
